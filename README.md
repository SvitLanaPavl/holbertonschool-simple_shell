## **_Introduction_** üì¢
This program is the recreation of the UNIX shell - a command line interpreter - that allows a user to interact with a computer by running commands or programs. The shell parses the commands and sends them to the operating system to perform.

## **_Description_** ‚úç
### The shell should do the following: ###

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines should handle arguments
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)
* Handle the PATH
* Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
* Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
* Handles interactive and non-interactive mode

## **_Implementation and Compilation_** üõ†
To start using this program, first, clone the repository 
`https://github.com/meisibley/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git`

and compile in the following way
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## **_How to use_** üîê
In your terminal, type `./hsh` to run the program. You will see the prompt `($)` which indicates that it is ready to receive the command. 
Currently, this simple shell handles the  *built-in* commands, for instance,

`cd` - change directory, followed by the path or with the options (e.g. `-` for previous working directory or `..` for moving one directory up)<br />
`exit` - exits the shell<br />
`env` - prints the current environment variables

They are run right away. However, if the commands are not built-ins, they are searched for in the `PATH` directory and then are executed. If the command is not found or the user does not have the permission to run it, there will be an error message.

## **_Examples_** üóÉ

**Example 1**

_builtin_
```
($) pwd
/holbertonschool-simple_shell
($) cd
/root
($) cd -
/holbertonschool-simple_shell
($) exit  
```
**Example 2**

_via PATH_
```
($) /bin/ls
README.md compil hsh main.c main.h shell.c test_ls_2
($) ls -la
($) total 48
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   120 Jul 27 23:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  4096 Jul 27 23:42 ..
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root   220 Jul 28 00:05 .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1257 Jul 27 23:57 README.md
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    77 Jul 27 23:42 compil
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 17560 Jul 27 23:42 hsh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1877 Jul 27 23:42 main.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   163 Jul 27 23:42 main.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1506 Jul 27 23:42 shell.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    16 Jul 27 23:42 test_ls_2
```
**Example 3**

_non-interactive mode_ will display the same output as the interactive one

```
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_25
```
## **_List of library functions and system calls used_** üìö

* `access()` - checks if a file or directory exists and is accessible;<br />
* `chdir()` - is used to change the current working directory of the process;<br />
* `execve()` - is used to execute a new program;<br />
* `exit()` - exits the shell;<br />
* `fork()` - is used to create a new process. The new process is called a child process, and the original process is called the parent process;<br />
* `free()` - is used to free the allocated memory;<br />
* `getcwd()` - gets the current working directory of the process;<br />
* `getline()` - reads a line of text from standard input;<br />
* `isatty()` - checks if a file descriptor refers to a terminal device;<br />
* `malloc()` - allocates memory on the heap;<br />
* `perror()` - prints an error message to standard error;<br />
* `printf()` - prints the formated output to standard output;<br />
* `signal()` - handles signals that can be sent to a process to interrupt or notify of an event;<br />
* `stat()` - gets the status of a file;<br />
* `strtok()` - parses the string;<br />
* `wait()` - waits for a child process to terminate;<br />
* `write()` -  is used to write data to a file descriptor;<br />

## **_List of custom functions_** üî®

* `void execmd(char **argv, char *actual_com)` - executes the command based on the path;<br />
* `char *get_location(char *command)` - gets the path of the command file;<br />
* `int get_num_token(char *lineptr)` - gets the number of tokens;<br />
* `void get_tokenize(char *lineptr)` - gets the input and parses it;<br />
* `void free_tokens(char **cmd_arr)` - frees the allocated memory for tokens;<br />
* `int space_handler(char *lineptr)` - takes care of spaces as input;<br />
* `char *_getenv(const char *name)` - searches the table of environment variable;<br />
* `void signal_handler(int signum)` - handles signal, making shell ignore CTRL-C;<br />
* `void print_err(char *command, char **argv)` - prints the error message;<br />
* `int builtins_handling(char **command)` - handles built-ins;<br />
* `void env_handler(void)` - handles environment;<br />
* `void cd_handler(char **command)` - handles the change of directory;<br />
* `void exit_handler(char **command)` - handles exit command;<br />
* `int permissions(char * command)` - checks the command for existance and permission to execute it;<br />
