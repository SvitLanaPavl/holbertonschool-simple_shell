.SH DESCRIPTION
The sshell utility is a command langrage interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command line string, the standard entrys, or a specified file. 

Pathname expansion shall not fail due to the size of a file.

Simple shell input and output redirections have an implementation-defined offset maximum that is established in the open file description.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP
.BR \-
A single <hyphen-minus> shall be treated as the first operand and then ignored. 
.TP
.BR argument
The positional parameters shall be set to arguments, if any.
.TP
.BR command_name
A string assigned to special parameter 0 when executing the commands in command_string. if command_name is not specified, special parameter 0 shall be set to the value of the first argument passed to sshell from its parent (i.e. argv[0] for a C program), which is normally a pathname used to execute the sshell utility.
.TP
.BR command_string
A string that shall be interpreted by the shell as one or more commands, as if the string were the argument to the system() defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2017. If the command_string operand is an empty string, sshell shall exit with a zeor exit status.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of sshell:
.TP
.BR ENV
This variable, when an interactive shell is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion by the shell, and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell commands to execute in the current environment. The file need not be executable. If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified.
.TP
.BR PATH                                                                                                      
Establish a string formatted as described in the Base Definitions, used to effect command interpretation.     
.TP                                                                                                           
.BR PWD                                                                                                       
This variable shall represent an absolute pathname of the current working directory. Assignments to this waria
ble may be ignored.                                                                                           
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS                                                                                       
The sshell utility shall take the standard action for some signals with the following exceptions.             
                                                                                                              
If the shell is interactive, SIGINT signals received during command line editing shall be handled as described
 in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION, and SIGINT signals received at other times shall be caught but no action perform
ed. SIGQUIT signal (CRTL_C) shall be ignored.                                                                 
.SH                                                                                                           
INPUT FILES or OUTPUT FILES

The script executes one or more commands that require input form standard input.                              
.TP                                                                                                           When the shell is using standard input and it invokes a command that also uses standard input, the simple shel
l shall ensure that the standard input file pointer points directly after the command it has read when the com
mand begins execution. It shall not read ahead in such a manner that any characters intended to be read by the
 invoked command are consumed by the shell or that characters that are now read by the invoked command are not
 seen by the shell. When the command expecting to read standard input is started asynchronously by an interact
ive shell, it is unspecified whether characters are read by the command or interpreted by the shell.
